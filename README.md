Overview of system:

Our project is a solver for the game scrabble. The solver will be able to find
 all possible words from a given coordinate in a given specific board. The user
 will first provide the board configuration, then prompt the program to solve
 with keyword "solve r c" where r and c are the row and column once all the
 information has been inputted. Then, the user will be prompted to input their
 hand, separated by spaces. Then the output will be all the possible words that
 can be played at that position. The board will be displayed in a text
 based terminal, where users can view the board whenever they wish,
 to make sure their added words are in the correct position.
